This directory contains the example programs for the MPI-2 tutorial, covering
parallel I/O and remote memory operations.

To build the tests, you can either edit the Makefiles in the example
directories (such as examples/life/Makefile) or use the configure
script to create the Makefiles.  If you use configure, use it like
this

./configure --with-mpi=path-to-dir-containing-mpicc

For example, if you have installed mpich2 into /usr/local/mpich2, with
the compilation script mpicc in /usr/local/mpich2/bin, then use

./configure --with-mpi=/usr/local/mpich2/bin

If your MPI doesn't use mpicc to compile MPI program, then either edit
the Makefiles directly or create simple versions of mpicc as scripts
that convert to the compilation form that your system requires.

The default make target will build the example programs.

The make target "notes" will create PDF versions of the programs
suitable for use in the tutorial.
